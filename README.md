# Out of body
Project to detect whether laparoscopic video frames are either inside or outside the patient's body.
 
This project includes a pre-trained model, which is the Inception_v3, trained on about 30.000 images. This model is stored under ./tf_files/retrained_graph.pb.
If you wish to retrain with your own dataset, use the ./scripts/retrain.py file to do so.
